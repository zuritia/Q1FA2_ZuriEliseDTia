        <h2>All Too Well</h2>
        <n>I walked through the door with you, the air was cold, but something about it felt like home somehow. 
            I left my scarf there at your sister's house, and you've still got it in your drawer even now.
            Your sweet disposition, and my wide-eyed gaze, we're singing in the car getting lost upstate
            Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place, and I can picture after all these days.
            I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more, and I might be okay but I'm not fine at all.
            'Cause there we are again on that little town street. You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me. Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.</n>
